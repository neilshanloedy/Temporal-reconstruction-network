## Repetition in Social Contacts: Implications in Modelling the Transmission of Respiratory Infectious Diseases in Pre-pandemic & Pandemic Settings ##

# Short summary of the study
In our study, we explored how human interactions impact the spread of respiratory viral infections. We utilised social contact data (POLYMOD and Belgian CoMix studies) to uncover the recurrent nature of contacts, which is often overlooked in traditional analyses. To bridge this gap, we undertake the task of describing individualsâ€™ contact patterns over time, by characterising the interactions made with distinct individuals during a week. By reconstructing individual contact patterns over time, we found fewer distinct new contacts compared to a naive approach that ignores contact repetition. This highlights the importance of considering contact frequency to avoid underestimating the probability of transmission. Using sophisticated modelling techniques, we show how this temporal reconstruction affects disease transmission, using data from pre-pandemic and pandemic scenarios. Our findings underscore the important role of longitudinal contact analyses in shaping effective public health strategies, offering valuable insights for disease control efforts.
